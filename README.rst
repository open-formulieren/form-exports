Form exports
============

A collection of re-usable forms, created and used by users of `Open Forms`_.
(`Nederlandse versie`_)

Introduction
============

Using `Open Forms`, administrators can quickly create powerful and smart forms
that can be exported and shared with others.

In line with the `Common Ground`_ philosophy, you can share your forms to help 
other organisations to setup their forms more quickly. These forms can be for
inspiration or ready for use.

The Open Forms export format contains `Form.io`_ form definitions, together
with various metadata. You can import these export files in your own Open Forms
installation.

The form exports files in this repository (CC0) and the Open Forms software 
(EUPL) itself, are open source and therefore free to use.
